      <ul>
        <li>Improved search engine rankings</li>

        <li>Make buttons at least 44px tall</li>
        <li>Ensure easy thumb navigation</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Content Strategy for Mobile</h2>
      <p>Mobile users consume content differently:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Front-load important information</li>
        <li>Use shorter paragraphs and sentences</li>
        <li>Implement expandable content sections</li>
